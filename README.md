# Tailwind CSS Class Not Found Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked issue in Tailwind CSS: using a class that's either misspelled, not included in your configuration files (e.g., `tailwind.config.js`), or not properly imported into your project.

## The Problem
The provided `bug.js` file contains a seemingly valid Tailwind CSS class. However, it might not render correctly because:

1. **Typo:** There might be a simple typo in the class name.
2. **Missing Configuration:** The class might not be defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file, especially if you are using custom configurations or plugins.
3. **Import Issue:**  The Tailwind directives (`@tailwind directives`) might not be correctly imported into your CSS file.

## Reproducing the Bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and observe the lack of styling if there is a problem (e.g., a misspelled Tailwind class).
3. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the correct implementation.
